# Before starting the model, update the following path(s).

# Specify where the model will place the folders containing the outputs for each simulation. If this directory does not
# exist, the model will automatically make it (asking you first). It's best to use an absolute path so it should look
# something like the following examples.
#    Windows -> C:\Gordon\Lightfoot
#    Linux -> /home/(user)/Simon/Garfunkel
#    MacOS -> /Users/(user)/Jim/Croce

# Put output path below
output_dir: /Users/ajin/PycharmProjects/Python-hiPSC-ABM-main/ABM/
